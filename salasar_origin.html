    <div class="panel-body">

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;"><a href="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-887" alt="Photo1" src="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo1-108x150.jpg" width="108" height="150" /></a>About 310 years ago, Thakur “Banwaridasji” was living in a village name as Naurangsar of Churu District (Rajasthan). His son “Tulsiramji” had four sons, out of which “Salam Singh” was the eldest. All the four brothers use to live in different villages named Naurangsar, Tidaki, Jiluliyasar and Salamsar respectively. The place where Salam Singh started residing was renamed as “Salamsar” which is now known as Salasar. <span id="more-235"></span>In the same village there was a saint whose name was Pandit Sukhramji who uses to do agricultural work for Thakurs of Ravasa and also various other religious works. Pandit Sukhramji got married to Kanhi Deviji who was daughter of Pandit Lachhiramji, residence of Rulyani village.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;">Within a few years Pandit Sukhramji earned lots of respect and money. He also became father of a son. He was living happily with his family, but unfortunately he died when his son was only 5 year old.  After her husband death, Kanhi deviji shifted to her in laws place at Rulyani village along with her son Uday. Pandit Lachiramji Patodia had 6 sons and 1 daughter. His youngest son Mohandasji was devotee of Hanumanji from childhood. At Mohandasji naming ceremony (Naamkaran) astrologers had predicted that he will become a great saint, who’ll be known for his deeds worldwide. Since childhood, he use to spend most of his time doing meditation as a result, he started departing from his family and the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 22px; color: #993300;"><b>Mohandasji Shifted to Salasar</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;"><a href="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-888" alt="Photo2" src="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo2-108x150.jpg" width="108" height="150" /></a>After few years, Kanhi deviji decided to settle down at Salasar where her husband used to live. All 5 brother of Kanhi deviji refused to stay at Salasar saying that they had their families and moreover they cannot eat anything at their sister’s place. At that moment Mohandasji with intention of helping her sister till his son attain adulthood also left Rulyani village and started staying with his sister at Salasar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;">Soon with his efforts he made his sister’s agricultural field extremely fertile. After few years his nephew Uday got married with a pleasant daughter of a bhrahmin of Ratau village (Distt. Nagaur). After marriage, with the advent of newly-wed daughter in law, money started flowing to Kanhi devi’s residence. They use help people by giving foods to needy, water to thirsty, place for rest to traveler etc. No beggar was returned empty handed from their home. They received blessings from all, as the donation done with the thought of charity, gives you quadrupled results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 22px; color: #993300;"><b>Lord Hanuman Inspiring Mohandasji</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;">One day during monsoons, when Mohandasji was doing agricultural work at that time Hanumanji himself appeared and restrained Mohandasji from doing this activity and direct him to start devoting his life toward meditation. However Mohandasji still tried to concentrate and do his agricultural work but Hanumanji ensured that Mohandasji failed every time. Udayramji was watching all this from far he was surprised by what his uncle was doing. He then went to his uncle and asked if his health was not fine he should take rest. At this Mohandasji said that there’s some god hounding him and not letting him work. When Udayramji went to home in evening he told his mother about the incident.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;"><a href="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-889" alt="Photo3" src="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo3-110x150.jpg" width="110" height="150" /></a>At this Kanhideviji decided to get Mohandasji married, as she thought marriage will bind him to the world, else he will become a celibate. Whenever Kanhideviji use to discuss about marriage with MohandasJi, she got only refusal. But she thought her brother is refusing due to hesitation, so she kept on searching for a good life partner. After much effort engagement got fixed. By selling grains at cheap price, gold jewelries were made for the engagement, and the mediator was sent to the girl’s house for marriage rituals. But before the mediator could reach the girl’s house, the girl died. Mohandasji had predicted this earlier. Everyone was shocked with his knowledge. After this incident, Kanhideviji dropped the thought of her brother’s marriage, and devoted herself to The Almighty. Mohandasji remained bachelor throughout his life became a passionate almighty follower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 22px; color: #993300;"><b>Lord Hanuman visit to Kanhidevi’s house</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;"><a href="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-890" alt="Photo4" src="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo4-106x150.jpg" width="106" height="150" /></a>Just as devotees wish to see god, similarly God also desire to meet his devotees. After few years, Hanumanji visited Kanhideviji’s residence disguised as monk and asked for alms. At that time, Kanhideviji was making food for her son and brother.  Hence she got delayed in giving the alms. As she went to her door for donation, she could not see anyone. She returned inside her home but had a feeling of the same sage inside.  At that moment, Mohandasji told her that the monk was Hanumanji himself, who came to meet us. So Kanhideviji urged to her brother to meet God. After about two months, again the same episode repeated. God Hanumanji disguised as monk came to their place and remarked – “Narayan Hari, Narayan Hari”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;">Kanhideviji told Mohandaasji that there’s a saint standing outside our home. At this, when Mohandasji went to meet the saint, he saw Hanumanji retreating.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;"><a href="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo6.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-891" alt="Photo6" src="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo6-99x150.jpg" width="99" height="150" /></a>Mohandasji followed Hanumanji, and after a long run, he took hold of Hanuman’s feet firmly. At this Hanumanji said, don’t follow me son, I am pleased with your selfless devotion, tell me your wish. At this Mohandasji demanded that Hanumanji must come to her sister’s place and stay there with them. Hanumanji said that I’ll definitely come along with you provided I am given a sacred place to sit and only Kheer (sweet made with milk and rice) and churma (sweet made with chapatti )  mixed with sugar to eat. When Mohandasji assured all, Hanumanji followed him to his sister’s place, sat and had Kheer and Churma. After satisfying his tasting buds, he rested on a bed specially prepared for him. After experiencing this brother &amp; sister love, he told Kanhideviji  and Mohandasji – <b>“No one will ever try to win me with money. I’ll accept whatever is given to me with love, and also bestow the required wishes to all my devotees as and when asked for.”</b> After saying all this, Hanumanji disappeared. After this incident Mohandasji left his sister’s home and started residing in a cottage made on top of a sand dune outside the village. There he engrossed himself in Hanumanji.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 22px; color: #993300;"><b>Mohandasji’s Miracles</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;">God’s true devotee isolates himself from worldly illusion and practice meditation. Thought hurdles do occur due to mundane activities of world, yet his heart’s cord with god never breaks. They become isolated by nature, as they realize devotion is only possible in isolation. As they transform into a secluded person, worldly people mistake them as “Mad”. This is the reason why Mohandasji was also known as “Baavaliya“(Rajasthani word for mad). To avoid conflicts of all worldly thirst, Mohandasji use to sit in a secluded area under a Shami tree and meditate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;"><a href="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo8.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-893" alt="Photo8" src="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo8-99x150.jpg" width="99" height="150" /></a>Once when Mohandasji was meditating under this tree flourished with fruits, one boy climbed the tree and started to pluck the fruits. But during this process few fruits dropped on Mohandasji, and he got afraid that it might be some bird who was trying to pluck the fruits got hurt. So, he opened his eyes and saw the boy standing in front of him. He inquired why the boy was here. Boy replied it was his father’s wish to have the fruits of this tree. Despite her mother’s refusal, his father sent him to pluck the fruits stating that the “Mad” saint was no harm to them. Mohandasji thereby warned the boy that his father would die if he had these fruits. As his father ignored saintly words, he died. Hence he got the punishment of his contempt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px;"><b><a href="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo7.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-892" alt="photo7" src="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo7-108x150.jpg" width="108" height="150" /></a></b></span><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px;">According to some theories, it is been said that Hanumanji use to play with Mohandasji under shami tree in secluded area. Once when Mohandasji’s nephew Udayaramji saw few injuries, the kind one gets while wrestling, so he inquired. But Mohandasji denied the fact and said that few innocent children have beaten him. As Udayramji was not satisfied by the answer, he told the detectives about the incident and asked them to investigate the truth by seeking the footsteps. But detectives got highly confused by watching the footsteps, as some of the footsteps were very huge and some very tiny, and few were invisible. They inquired Mohandasji directly saying that these could be either of gods or of demons. After this incident people were filled with respect and faith for Mohandasji increased a lot.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; line-height: 1.5em; color: #ff0000;">Salasar Village was under Bikaner state at that time and it was run by Thakurs. Salasar and nearby village called Shobhasar was ruled by Dheeraj Singh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;"><a href="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo9.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-894" alt="Photo9" src="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo9-105x150.jpg" width="105" height="150" /></a>Out of nowhere, a unknown dacoit accompanied by hundreds of riders came in close proximity with Salasar. At dawn the dacoit decided to camp nearby Salasar and ordered some of his riders to get the food and beverages from Salasar and if the people refuse to provide, he ordered to kill them. As the Thakur came to know about it, they got extremely scared and went to Mohandasji for help. Mohandasji assured them about their safety, and asked them to blow the enemy’s flag before they enter the village. Thakur’s did exactly what he said and they were saved by god’s grace. After this incident Thakur Salam Singh’s devotion towards Hanumanji increased manifold and so did his trust in Mohandasji. In this way Mohandasji saved life of villagers several times from epidemics in miraculous way by his truthfulness and god’s grace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 22px; color: #993300;"><b>Foundation stone of Salasar Temple</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;">In year 1811 Mohandasji decided and pledged to construct a temple for Hanumanji. To accomplish the same he asked Thakur Salam Singh to get the idol from his father in law, who was Asota’s Thakur.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;"><a href="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo11.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-896" alt="Photo11" src="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo11-100x150.jpg" width="100" height="150" /></a>After few days in the morning during sunrise, a Jat farmer in Asota while plowing his field suddenly got his plow stuck and heard a hitting sound. So he digged that area and saw a statue, but due to disregard he neglected that statue. In few minutes he started suffering from an awful abdominal pain, and due to this pain he had to lie down and soon went asleep. During mid-day he explained the story to his wife, who was very wise. So she cleans the stone statue with her saree. After cleaning she saw that the stone statue was divine and was graved with Ram –Lakshman on Hanumanji’s shoulder. So with great faith and devotion she took the idol near the root of the tree and installed it there.  After this she offered the churma and prayed to the idol. Then a miracle happened. The farmer who was suffering from abdominal pain suddenly became absolutely fine and started doing his regular farm work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;">This incident became extremely popular. And so listening to all the philosophies Thakur of Asota desired to worship the idol, and after worshipping the idol he brought the idol in his palace.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;"><a href="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo12.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-897" alt="Photo12" src="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo12-109x150.jpg" width="109" height="150" /></a>While sleeping, at midnight, in his dream Hanumanji himself appeared and asked him to immediately send the idol to Salasar. When the day dawned, Thakur sent the idol of Hanumanji in his personal bull cart with security while chanting Hanumanji’s name, at Salasar. </span><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; color: #ff0000;">At the same night Mohandasji dreamt of Hanumanji, and in his dream Hanumanji told him that to fulfill the promise given to you I am coming as a self statuesque black stone, which Thakur of Asota will be sending in his security. You establish the idol on this sand dune in presence of Thakur Salam Singh. As he got the order in his dream, he got up early next morning, and after doing his daily routine activity he went in the village to tell all the villagers about it. And then taking all the villagers he started walking to Asota chanting Hanumanji’s name, to welcome his idol. All villagers followed him chanting the name and dancing. After few miles, near Pavalok pond, the devotee and The God met. Followed by this meeting, the bull cart went on to the way towards Salasar on its own.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;">After reaching Salasar a problem occurred as people could not decide where the idol should get established. At this Mohandasji said – let the cart find its own way. And then cart after walking few steps stopped at a place on the sand dune, and that is where the idol was established and small temple for Hanumanji was constructed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;">In 1811, Mohandasji while meditating got so connected with god that tears started pouring from his eyes. In this state of bliss, he started to adorn Hanumanji’s Idol with vermillion (sindoor) and ghee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;">At that time, the idol changed its structure from Hanumnaji holding Ramji and Lakhsmanji on his shoulders to Hanumanji with a beard, a moustache, tilak on forehead, beautiful eyes and knotty eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 22px; color: #993300;"><b>Miracles of Salasar Temple</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;"><a href="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo14.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-899" alt="Photo14" src="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo14-108x150.jpg" width="108" height="150" /></a>Soon the temple’s grandness kept on increasing. After some time Thakur of Sikar, Maharaja Devisingh came to Salasar to meet Mohandasji for fulfilling his wish of having a son. Mohandasji asked him to tie a pious coconut (Shri Phal) on the branch of tree inside the temple premises and asked him to get married to Dujod village’s resident Mahovat Singh’s daughter. After about 10 months from when Mohandasji predicted, a son was born to Devisinghji. After this incident, the practice of tying a pious coconut on the tree has prevailed, and though tree is not there in today’s temple premises, the pious coconut is tied at other locations like back gate, a tree in temple’s premises, etc. Increasing amount of coconut tell the importance of this practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 22px; color: #993300;"><b>Handing over of administration to Kanhidevi’s Son</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;">In year 1850, Mohandasji gave all his responsibilities of temple to his nephew Udayramji and took Samadhi alive. Even today successors of Udayramji’s two sons Isardasji and Kaniramji take care of the temple administration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;"><a href="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo15.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-900" alt="Photo15" src="../salasarbalajitemple.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Photo15-111x150.jpg" width="111" height="150" /></a>At the entrance of the temple is the place where Mohandasji use to meditate. That place is called “Dhuna” and there is immortal ablaze at this place now. Today all the gates and windows are made of silver plated beautiful god’s artifacts, artifacts are adorned with spiritual and knowledgeable couplets having beautiful meanings. Similarly in the temple’s main entrance five idols are kept along with “Sri Ram Darbar” (hindu god’s family), where in middle is Mohandasji’s sculpture, left being Ramji and Hanumaji and right being Kanhi deviji  and her husband Sukhramji.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva; font-size: 14px; color: #ff0000;">Among the various rituals which are performed today at the temple are Aarti once at morning 4 am which is known as Mangala Aarti, once at evening 10pm which is known as Sandhya Aarti. The timing of these aarti gets changed to 5 am and 9 pm during winters. During afternoon Hanumanji is given dry fruits as bhoog which is then distributed among the various devotees presented there at that time.</span></p>
